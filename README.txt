This is a solo project I'm working on over the summer. The goal is to create a machine learning program that will
optimize the way my family and I play "grid," a card game that was shown to us by some family friends.

Planning to make an app for this as well.

Grid Java is a text based version of the card game coded in Java

Grid Python is a graphics based version of the card game coded in Python
